      <p>Hello, I’m Quyen (don’t stress out about how you pronounce it, because I don’t really mind. It is Quinn )</p>

      <p>As a high school graduated, I started a freelance gig with my partner where we make promo videos and commercials for real estate, restaurants and even music videos. Honestly anything I could get my hands on. One day, a client asked if I can make website too, so I said yes. Of course at the time I didn’t know how, but thankful for YouTube and google. I slowly learn through self-taught and the passion start growing with it too. I am at a point where I want to sharpen my skillset and become good at it. Understand how thing really work in the backend and that is why I am currently on a coding program with UCLA as I’m finishing up my AA.</p>

      <p> With strong personality traits and an entrepreneur mindset, I still believe in being apart of a team. Something bigger than myself, that’s the only way you can extend your reach and help more people.</p>
